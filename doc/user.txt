1. Navigation                                                  *user.navigation*

Navigation in NeoVim is generally done using the `h`, `j`, `k`, & `l` keys for
cardinal directions. Navigations which does not use this can sometimes use `u`
and `d` to indicate '[u]p' and '[d]own', `g` to for '[g]o', `f` for '[f]ind', or
some non-generic atomic operation.

Most navigation in this configuration follows this standard, although
there are some exceptions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 In-File Navigation                                 *user.in_file_navigation*

In-file nagivation can be split into three parts: vertical (get to the
line), horizontal (get to the character), and search (get somewhere).

`|======================|`
 `1.1a Vertical Movement`                                 *user.vertical_movement* 

Vertical movement is relatively simple, mainly consisting of chaining
fixed-size jumps.

`k` and `j` take you up an down a line, `<C-u>` and `<C-d>` do the same but
for a half-page. `gg` and `G` take you to the top and bottom lines of the
  file, `H` and `L` do the same for your screen.

Prepending a number before `k` or `j` jumps you that many lines in the
direction. This can be combined with relative line numbers to make the
required number visible.

An effective strategy for vertical movement is using `<C-u>` & `<C-d>` to
scroll around and finishing with a specific length relative jump with
`[count]k` or `[count]j`.

If you know the specific line numbers, `[count]G`, `[count]gg`, or
`:[count]<BR>` will all take you to a line number.

`[count]%` will take you to the line that percent down the file.

`(` or `)`, and `{` or `}` will take you forward/backward through sentances
and paragraphs respectively.

`|========================|`
 `1.1b Horizontal Movement`                             *user.horizontal_movement*

Horizontal movement is significantly more complex. Effective horizontal
movement involves quick jumps to identified landmarks (e.g. a letter,
brackets, the start of the line).

`h` and `l` take you backwards and forwards on a line. These can be prefixed
with [count] but counting characters is hard.

There are quite a few keys which take you to the start or end of a line in
different flavors, these are all useful to some extent:
- `0` takes you to the first character on a line.
- `$` takes you to the last one (this persists when going up/down).
- `^` takes you to the first non-blank character.
  - `_` does the same thing but also takes you [count] - 1 down (this is
  generally indistinguishable from `^`).
  - `-` and `+` do the same thing but take you [count] lines up or down.
- `g_` takes you the the last non-blank character and [count] (this is not
  very useful as you don't see this often and it doesn't persist like `$`).
- Prefixing one of the non-up/down keys with `g` (`g0`, `g$`, or `g^`) does
the same thing but on the screen line. `g<END>` acts like the `g_` equivalent
of `g^` but it's not very useful and I don't have the key on my keyboard.

The main meat of horizontal movement is in find operators. These take you to
instances of characters, relative to the cursor, in the current line:
- `f{char}` takes you to the next instance of {char} to the right.
- `F{char}` takes you to the next instance of {char} to the left.
- `t{char}` takes you to the character before the next instance to the right.
- `T{char}` takes you to the character before the next instance to the left.
- All of these operators can be prepended with [count] to go to the [count]th
  {char}.
- `;` repeats the last find operator [count] times.
- `,` repeats the last find operator [count] times in the other direction.

Another method for horizontal movement is using word operators. These act on
words (contiguous letters, digits, or underscores or contiguous other
characters, separated by whitespace) or WORDS (contiguous characters separated
by whitespace).
- `w` takes you forward [count] words, to the start of a word.
- `W` takes you forward [count] WORDS, to the start of a word.
- `b` takes you backward [count] words, to the start of a word.
- `B` takes you backward [count] WORDS, to the start of a word.
- `e` takes you forward [count] words, to the end of a word.
- `E` takes you forward [count] WORDS, to the end of a word.
- `ge` takes you backward [count] words, to the end of a word.
- `gE` takes you backward [count] WORDS, to the end of a word.

 `1.1c  In-File Searching`                                *user.in_file_searching*

The final form of navigation in files is searching.
